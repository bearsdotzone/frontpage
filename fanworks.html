<h2 align="center">Here's fan media I've created!</h2>

<p align="center">I've been following Blaseball for a long time and I'm a creative type
bear so I've been happy to flex my expressive muscles with my team, whether it be lore
jams or different arts.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Season 1</h2>

<hr>

<p align="center">I created my Blaseball account on the 22nd of July 2020. If I had to
guess I'd consider it likely that somebody over at Waypoint retweeted the Game Band's
release announcement. But honestly I checked out the site, made an account, voted
&quot;heheh forbidden book&quot; with my freebie and called it quits. I saw there was a
Discord but I was pretty resistant to joining. I chose to be a fan of the Yellowstone
Magic because they were the team that was closest ideologically to bears. I considered a
Texas team but neither are really my vibe.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Season 2</h2>

<hr>

<p align="center">When season 2 started, I joined the Discord I had originally forsaken. I
needed to talk to people about the hellmouth opening. The Discord was so much smaller
then. I muted a few channels, but was able to keep up on general and lore pretty easily.
Chat was slow and we didn't have watch party, so some of my earliest messages are
&quot;wow check out that triple!&quot; I kinda messed around with voting but didn't keep
it consistent by any means. I was really expecting our team to do well considering we were
first seed for season 1. That didn't happen. We also continued a streak of not being
blessed because as far as I know, the blessing we were supposed to receive at the end of
season 1 was bugged and didn't happen. I was pretty active with fanart and lore in this
season. It was hard not to be, the barrier to entry was &quot;lol wouldn't it be funny if
famous was on the team because of nepotism&quot; Inky was a slam dunk, I love Inky's arc
after &quot;squid play baseball&quot; the blagonball :)) Washer was a pretty easy jump of
logic for us, I think I contributed &quot;you gotta throw a hat in there, you need a hat
to play blaseball&quot; RIV to Sosa and Famous, two real ones. Though obviously Hex and
Cory have deep holds on my heart.</p>

<h2 align="center">Inky Rutledge Rookie Card :000</h2>

<p align="center">2020-07-30</p>

<p align="center">My first ever Blaseball fan art! I love the subtle motion of the ball
and I'm glad squid Inky has been such a hit, even leading us to Binky my beloved!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/inkyrookie.gif" width="450" height="299" alt="A faded baseball card depicts a Minecraft squid in a wizard hat. A baseball floats tantalizingly nearby."></p>

<h2 align="center">Wizard Hat with Brim</h2>

<p align="center">2020-07-31</p>

<p align="center">Funnily enough I invert this joke about a year and a half later. Made in
Blender3D over the course of <em>minutes</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Bevan Wise Tarot Card</h2>

<p align="center">2020-08-02</p>

<p align="center">Tarot sized blaseball cards for magic players was an easy pull. It's
super funny for me to think about a foil wrapped pack of cards that's clearly larger than
all the others because it has magic cards in it. Then my headcanon for Bevan Wise as an
older black woman combined with my love of emoji combined to form the Bevan Wise Tarot
Card.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/BevanWise.png" width="240" height="415" alt="A tarot style card depicting a black woman in red robes holding a staff. Trees and plants adorn the borders. It says, &quot;IV - The Wise&quot;">

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Season 3 - 7</h2>

<hr>

<p align="center">I took a mini siesta from Blaseball around this time. It wasn't five
seasons long but I can't find any contributions I made to the culture at this time. I was
kinda turned off by the peanut showing up and talking about peanut fraud like a
disappointed teacher. That and the mini siesta after season 3 likely lead to my mild
disappearance. I recall the team chat being busy one day, so I muted it and kind of forgot
about it. I have ADHD lol. A few.... weeks? Later I got a ping from FruitCrumble aka
CritFumble who is by extension the only reason Blaseball has had such a big impact on my
life. I was able to get back into it, start following again. I'm not sure if it was Season
2 or Season 3 that the keeps came into Magic chat and told us to pick some mods. I did not
volunteer. I have no interest in community management, a position I still hold. Who did we
vote in then? I'm just going to start rattling off archrangers I remember. Liv Mac Phas

<h2 align="center">Park Ranger</h2>

<p align="center">2020-09-25</p>

<h2 align="center">Fishing Net Propaganda</h2>

<p align="center">2020-10-06</p>

<p align="center">We really wanted to get fishing net. Ironically this propaganda is
apropos for neocites.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/fishes.gif" width="450" height="319" alt="Fish gifs cover an ancient Yahoo home page. &quot;Dad got on the internet to say give the Magic a net&quot;"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Glover</h2>

<p align="center">2021-10-07</p>

<p align="center">We <em>really </em>wanted the fishing net. This got poorly changed into
red wizard robes at some point, but I can't find that version.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Assa Beeb</h2>

<p align="center">2021-10-09</p>

<p align="center">Yellowstone's slogan of &quot;as above so below&quot; got cursed into
&quot;assa beeb abba soos&quot; at some point. This is the foregone conclusion of that.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/assabeeb.png" width="450" height="740" alt="assabeeb.png (375551 bytes)"></p>

<h2 align="center">Season 10</h2>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Bonk Jokes Lorejam</h2>

<p align="center">2020-10-14</p>

<p align="center">I'm very happy where we eneded up with Bonk, but my initial suggestion
was a Jack in the Box wielding a bat.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/bonk.png" width="450" height="379" alt="a jack in the box labelled bonk and jokes, instead of a clown there is a baseball bat"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Season 11</h2>

<hr>

<p align="center">This is the last season before the Grand Siesta. We knew it was coming
and I recall being pretty resistant to the idea of a side server. I was wrong. Any sort of
intellectual attraction I have to an epistolary communication method is overshadowed
dramatically by my desire to shitpost. I think we had a really good time in the side
server. I posted bears over 1000 times. I'm glad we went back to maincord afterwards
though.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">SSPP - Super Secret Positivity Project</h2>

<p align="center">2020-10-09</p>

<p align="center">The original PSP was Phas' secret plan, which as I recall was attempts
to sponsor a season of blaseball before TGB said they didn't feel comfortable about a team
doing that. Fair enough. I believe Aya organized this project to send the archrangers a
little something something for their good work.</p>

<h2 align="center">Everbody's Moz</h2>

<p align="center">2020-11-12</p>

<p align="center">Don't remember why this happened, but everybody became Moz. This is a
personal throwback because I remember when I identified as cis and used picrew profile
pictures. Classic.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/mozSanta.png" width="450" height="450" alt="mozSanta.png (216178 bytes)"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Minecraft Server</h2>

<p align="center">2020-11-13</p>

<p align="center">I ran a fairly active Minecraft 1.16 server for the Grand Siesta crew.
It's actually the first place I had contact with my now girlfriend, so that's fun. I
should put the archive up somewhere, for posterity.</p>

<p align="center">2021-03-07</p>

<p align="center">I can't claim that this was actually my doing, but I saw a swap Cory for
Weatherman heckpost in Magic chat and the idea was hilarious to me. I dropped all my saved
