<h2 align="center">Here's fan media I've created!</h2>

<p align="center">I've been following Blaseball for a long time and I'm a creative type
bear so I've been happy to flex my expressive muscles with my team, whether it be lore
jams or different arts.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Inky Rutledge Rookie Card :000</h2>

<p align="center">2020-07-30</p>

<p align="center">My first ever Blaseball fan art! I love the subtle motion of the ball
and I'm glad squid Inky has been such a hit, even leading us to Binky my beloved!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/inkyrookie.gif" width="450" height="299" alt="A faded baseball card depicts a Minecraft squid in a wizard hat. A baseball floats tantalizingly nearby."></p>

<h2 align="center">Wizard Hat with Brim</h2>

<p align="center">2020-07-31</p>

<p align="center">Funnily enough I invert this joke about a year and a half later. Made in
Blender3D over the course of <em>minutes</em>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/magichat.png" width="450" height="514" alt="A 3D render of a red and yellow bespeckled wizard hat with a baseball cap brim. A star adorns the tip."></p>

<h2 align="center">Anjanath</h2>

<p align="center">2020-08-01</p>

<p align="center">I forget the context lol</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tenor.gif" width="450" height="258" alt="An Anjanath throws its arms menacingly, fortunately it holds a baseball"></p>

<h2 align="center">Bevan Wise Tarot Card</h2>

<p align="center">2020-08-02</p>

<p align="center">Tarot sized blaseball cards for magic players was an easy pull. It's
super funny for me to think about a foil wrapped pack of cards that's clearly larger than
all the others because it has magic cards in it. Then my headcanon for Bevan Wise as an
older black woman combined with my love of emoji combined to form the Bevan Wise Tarot
Card.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/BevanWise.png" width="240" height="415" alt="A tarot style card depicting a black woman in red robes holding a staff. Trees and plants adorn the borders. It says, &quot;IV - The Wise&quot;">

<h2 align="center">Park Ranger</h2>

<p align="center">2020-09-25</p>

<p align="center">The National Park Service posted a great macroable image.</p>

<h2 align="center">Fishing Net Propaganda</h2>

<p align="center">2020-10-06</p>

<p align="center">We really wanted to get fishing net. Ironically this propaganda is
apropos for neocites.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/fishes.gif" width="450" height="319" alt="Fish gifs cover an ancient Yahoo home page. &quot;Dad got on the internet to say give the Magic a net&quot;"></p>

<p align="center">We <strong>really</strong> wanted the fishing net.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Glover</h2>

<p align="center">2021-10-07</p>

<p align="center">We <em>really </em>wanted the fishing net. This got poorly changed into
red wizard robes at some point, but I can't find that version.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/glover.png" width="450" height="254" alt="The wizard from Glover is giving you a thumbs up &quot;Wyatt Glover's dad wants a fishing net, let the Glovers fish&quot;"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Bonk Jokes Lorejam</h2>

<p align="center">2020-10-14</p>

<p align="center">I'm very happy where we eneded up with Bonk, but my initial suggestion
was a Jack in the Box wielding a bat.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/bonk.png" width="450" height="379" alt="a jack in the box labelled bonk and jokes, instead of a clown there is a baseball bat"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Bonk Joke</h2>

<p align="center">2020-10-29</p>

<p align="center">I took <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Bonk_Jokes#/media/File:Bonk_and_glover_by_batfights.png">hatfights</a>'
very good art style and ruined it with this joke. Bonk signs, mostly.</p>

<h2 align="center">Art Switcharound</h2>

Crash and Aya.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Jaylen's Visit</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-02</p>

<p align="center">We very briefly entertained Jaylen Hotdogfingers of Blaseball fame.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/hotdogfingers.png" width="450" height="346" alt="A wizard looks questioningly on at bright red hands &quot;Hot dogs for fingers you say? A transmutation accident?&quot;"></p>

<h2 align="center">Oscar Dollie Gurgie</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-03</p>

<p align="center">Somebody took a sip of our goat!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/oscardolliegurgie.png" width="450" height="449" alt="A forehead eyed goat stares you in the eyes. You are looking down the barrel of a straw sucking directly from its forehead eye."></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">King Weatherman</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-07</p>

<p align="center">I can't claim that this was actually my doing, but I saw a swap Cory for
Weatherman heckpost in Magic chat and the idea was hilarious to me. I dropped all my saved
up votes on it and then wimdy stole our hearts. Second image is Chorby Short giving the
newly recruited Weatherman some friendly ribbing.</p>

<h2 align="center">Sutton Picklestein</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-08</p>

<p align="center">An OG player entering the hall of shadows. Bittersweet for sure.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/sutton1.png" width="450" height="314" alt="Famous Oconnor, Sosa Elftower, Annie Roland, and Richardson Turqoise greet Sutton warmly as he enters the hall of flame."></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Kurt Crueller Lore Jam</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-11</p>

<p align="center">I liked the idea of fisher Kurt whipping balls out of the air with a
fishing rod.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/kurtcrueller.png" width="450" height="208" alt="A faceless blaseball hero extends forth dramatically, whipping a ball out of the air with a fishing rod hook."></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Sutton's Hat</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-12</p>

<p align="center">Somewhere, the energy of Picklestein is felt. His hat levitates a few
inches off its place on the mantle.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/suttonhat.png" width="450" height="259" alt="A levitating hat"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Sutton Picklestein (2)</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-14</p>

<p align="center">Sutton was necromancied and immediately went back to the hall. Iconic.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/sutton2.png" width="450" height="247" alt="The same hall of flame pic as earlier, but rather than welcoming arms, Famous' arms are raised in exasperation saying &quot;Y'all how did sutton get over there?&quot; Sutton is in the flowers corner of the hall"></p>

<h2 align="center">Tiana Wheeler Lore Jam</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-15</p>

<p align="center">The opposite of nominative determinism</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">No Gods No Kings Weatherman</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-16</p>

<p align="center">Old Man Logan Rodriguez having a back tattoo is very good.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/nogodsnokingsweatherman.png" width="450" height="424" alt="A man's back is tattooed with &quot;No Gods No Kings Weatherman&quot; A tattoo gun is poorly adding &quot;Yes&quot; between King and Weatherman.

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Cursed Barl</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-18</p>

<p align="center">We are all love Carl. Well, we love Mee6 more but he's in the shadows
now. Regardless, Carl didn't deserve to be turned into a Barl.</p>

<h2 align="center">Sports Game</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-18</p>

<p align="center">What blaseball might look like as an early video game. Refined later.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/sportsgame.png" width="320" height="240" alt="An over the shoulder pitching game with UI"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Blaseball the Pico8 Game</h2>

<p align="center">2021-3-20</p>

<p align="center">Not functional, but I did draw this in Pico8</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/blaseball.gif" alt="Midway between an Atari and NES style, depicts a video game interface of an anxious pitching machine going against Chorby Short's infamous &quot;Foul Ball 0-2&quot;" WIDTH="384" HEIGHT="384"></p>

<h2 align="center">Feral Ranger Warning</h2>

<p align="center">2021-03-20</p>

<p align="center">Magic Discord fans are rangers. This sign warns you of chat ferality,
what we call an active chat.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/feralwarning.png" width="450" height="337" alt="A nature warning sign with the depiction of a bear &quot;Feral Warning&quot; &quot;All rangers are dangerous. Stay in your vehicle if rangers are encountered.&quot; The message repeats in French"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Spectral Chorb</h2>

<p align="center">2021-04-06</p>

<p align="center">Redacted Chorby would give horrible ghostly batting advice.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/spectralchorb.png" width="450" height="389" alt="Chorby appears as a force ghost, recommending the Magic player swing at a ball that is clearly outside of the strike zone."></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Froggone</h2>

<p align="center">2021-04-06</p>

<p align="center">Chorby! Where did she go!? Redacted ?!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/froggone.png" width="450" height="391" alt="A frog emoji poorly overlays the &quot;Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego&quot; CD cover. Chorby Short in wordart font covers the name of Carmen."></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Collage Bonk</h2>

<p align="center">2021-04-08</p>

<p align="center">That Magic the Gathering card with the <a href="http://faithless%20looting">cool collage art</a> had just dropped so I had collages
on the mind. I also like the look of old school anatomical drawings, so I composed a Bonk
Jokes at the X Games. (he hit the grind rail a lot that season)</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Math Bear</h2>

<p align="center">2021-05-11</p>

<p align="center">Without looking it up I'm choosing to believe this was in reaction to
fractional runs from fractional suns.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/mathbear.gif" width="450" height="287" alt="A confused looking bear has math floating in front of its face"></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Propaganda for Magic to journey into the Horizon</h2>

<p align="center">2021-07-28</p>

<p align="center">Something we say in Magic is &quot;vote with your heart&quot; so I did.
And dropped like 30k votes on Horizon in one action, meaning our path towards the desert
was hindered for about an hour.</p>
